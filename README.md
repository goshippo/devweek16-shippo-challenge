# DeveloperWeek 2016 Hackathon - Shippo Challenge

*Excited to have you working on the Shippo Challenge for Developer Week 2016!*

**For fast debugging, join our Shippo Hacks Slack group by sending an email to shan@goshippo.com!**

### About the challenge
[At Shippo](https://goshippo.com/), we build shipping APIs and dashboards connecting e-commerce stores to multiple carriers like USPS, FedEx, UPS etc., all from within one system.  

For this challenge, get pre-launch access to our newest Tracking API to pull shipment tracking information from all major carriers in one place. 

**Use the new Tracking API to build a better shipment tracking visualization and alert app. We'll be providing you with a live feed of tracking numbers to play with.**

Here are some ideas that we brewed up:

* Real-time shipment visualization
* Chrome app to check on where all your shipments are
* Facebook notifications or Apple Watch alerts when your package arrives.

**Let us know what you're working on by creating a project under the [Shippo Challenge on Accelerate.im](http://www.accelerate.im/challenges/52) so that we can track it for the final hackathon judging.**
