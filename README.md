# DeveloperWeek 2016 Hackathon - Shippo Challenge

**Excited to have you working on the Shippo Challenge for Developer Week 2016!** 

#### About the challenge
At Shippo, we build APIs and dashboards connecting e-commerce stores to carriers. Every month, ship millions of packages around the world. For this challenge, get pre-launch access to our newest Tracking API to pull shipment tracking information from all major carriers in one place. 

**Use it to build a better shipment tracking visualization and alert app.**

Here are some ideas that we brewed up:

* Real-time shipment visualization
* Chrome app to check on where all your shipments are
* Facebook notifications or Apple Watch alerts when your package arrives.

#### How to use the Tracking API
It's easy to access the Tracking API. Simply send a GET request to our Tracking Endpoint: `https://api.goshippo.com/v1/tracks/<CARRIER>/<TRACKING-NUMBER>/`

To see which carriers we support, sample responses, and how to sync tracking with webhooks, [head to our docs](http://r.goshippo.com/tracking-api-docs).

*Webhooks are free to use for all hackathon apps.*

#### Setup
1. [Ali to add more instructions here]
2. Create a Shippo account so that you can add webhooks--- can we make a specific link? UTM tag? so we can track? 

#### Judging Criteria
We will be judging hacks according to the following criterias. We'll be awarding the winning team an Apple Watch for each active member.

Criteria | Weight (1-4) | Score (1-5)
